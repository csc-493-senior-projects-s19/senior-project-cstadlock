This project is called FFBE Armory it is basically going to be an Android Application that servers as a wiki for the game FFBE I enjoy this game and that is what led to the idea of the creation of it. This serves as my Capstone project for Berea College. 

If you have any questions or concerns please email me: christopher.s.tadlock@gmail.com or tadlockc@berea.edu

(EVERYTHING BELOW THIS IS IN REGARDS TO CODE LOCATED ON GOOGLE DRIVE AND CODE SUBMITTED TO MOODLE)
Android Studio uses XML and Java files primarily to make its applications work properly but the files can be a bit tricky to locate if you do not know what to look for so I will lay out what you need to be on the lookout for. 

All my XML relevant to manipulation to add upon this project can be found at 
MyApplication\app\src\main\res\layout
This will bring you to files such as 
Activity_armory_page.xml
activity_axe_category_selection.xml
activity_bow_category_selection.xml
activity_daggers_category_selection.xml
activity_fists_category_selection.xml
…. And so on. 

All of the photos used for the application can be found at
MyApplication\app\src\main\res\drawable

As for things such as strings they can be found at
MyApplication\app\src\main\res\values

All of the relevant Java files for manipulation of this application can be found at 
MyApplication\app\src\main\java\com\tadlockc\ffbearmory

These are the most relevant files for the project as of now there are other files within the submission that are vital to the operation of the application such as the manifest but that has to do with the actual functionality of the application and not the content of the FFBE Armory application so that is all that’s really needed to be known to look for but as you can see from looking at the locations listed above every addition to the applications is a daunting task since it requires you to add so many correlating data points be in xml, java, or strings. However, once you get the knack of it operating in Android Studio with these files can become very fluid. All of the code is also commented to represent what it is doing simply take a look into the code to see more as to what I mean. Thanks for using FFBE Armory and reading this README file.. 

The code repositiory can be found on the github repository provided to the class or from the google drive url:
